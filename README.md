### General information about the map / Behind the scenes and trivia.
This map was a simple project i was aiming to do for a while, since in SM227 speedmapping pack i remade Dungeoncrawl (my first map ever created) and i created a conclussion in Dungeonascension, why not make a midquel? As simple as that is i decided proceed to make it, while in my "Quake mapping" career i decided to stuck with Alkaline even for small projects and i thought on switching it, i think Copper is the best course of action due to my appreciation of the vanilla+ of the game in most aspects.

The order of release is the chronological order (Dungeonescape then Dungeonspeed), so i proceeded to recreate or well remix-rework the parts of the map, maintaining a bit the comedy behind it and trying to focus on the platforming aspect of it in a way... keeping it in the spirit of this is my second and third map ever created with a bit more of mapping work and experience behind it.

Dungeonescape was recreated mostly in it's entirety with reworks on certain areas and adds... while i wanted to connect the whole first part of the map (silver key) normally and i would have done it i thought it would be unnecesarily longer, so i used a teleport to go back and well, that concludes the first part of the map.

Dungeonspeed was the harshest to recreate, while i appreciate past Chuma's intention of learning how to make an elevator that justified the creation of a map, it had a lot of empty space with nothing, this was chopped down keeping the final confrontation and having some new area added ( i didn't even recreate the ramp of the beginning because i felt it was unnecessary).

The final trivia is that i added Dopefish because in none of these 2 original maps Dopefish was present, Dopefish salutes Ranger, not for a final time, but at least for this mission, at least in regards to the dungeon saga, hope you guys have fun with this entry.
